# Graphql API Styleguide - Apollo, Nexus, Prisma

## Structure

Graphql-Apis should be structured in three layers. The resolver-layer, the service-layer and the model-layer, as shown in the picture below.

![alt text](/images/api.png "Logo Title Text 1")

This can be achieved by a folder structure like this:

```
graphql/
  modules/
    user/
      service/
        userService.ts        // User service
        userService.spec.ts
      query.ts                // query resolvers and object type definitions
      mutation.ts             // mutation resolvers and input type definitions
      validation.ts           // validation schemas (Joi)
  permissions/
    query.ts                  // query permissions
    mutation.ts               // mutation permissions
  utils/
    validation.ts             // validation helper methods
```

## Services

Every entity in the database that can be accessed through the api has its own service, f.e. the `UserService`. There might be additional services like an `AuthService` or services to communicate with 3rd party apis. Services export themselves as a singleton and communicate with other services through dependency injection.

```js
export class UserService {
  private prisma: PrismaClient;

  constructor({ prisma }) {
    this.prisma = prisma;
    // add additional services here
  }

  private getHashedPassword(password: string) {
    return hash(password, 10);
  }


  async create(data: Prisma.UserCreateInput) {
    // enter business logic here
    const { password, ...rest } = data;
    const hashedPassword = await this.getHashedPassword(password);

    return this.prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        ...rest,
        password: hashedPassword,
      },
    });
  }

  findAll(params: {
    skip?: number;
    take?: number;
    cursor?: Prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput;
    where?: Prisma.UserWhereInput;
    orderBy?: Prisma.UserOrderByInput;
  }) {
    const { skip, take, cursor, where, orderBy } = params;
    return this.prisma.user.findMany(params);
  }

  findOne(where: Prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput) {
    return this.prisma.game.findUnique({
      where,
    });
  }

  update(params: {
    where: Prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput;
    data: Prisma.UserUpdateInput;
  }) {
    // enter business logic here
    const { where, data } = params;
    const newPassword = data.password
      ? await this.getHashedPassword(data.password as string)
      : undefined;

    return this.prisma.user.update({
      data: {
        ...data,
        password: newPassword,
      },
      where,
    });
  }

  remove(where: Prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput) {
    // enter business logic here
    return this.prisma.game.delete({
      where,
    });
  }
}

export default new UserService({ prisma });
```

This is a base class for the user entity that handles crud operations of users. The prisma service gets injected as a dependency. Business logic in this case is the handling of hashing passwords before inserting it into the database. There could be other things like triggering an e-mail, creation of other entities (and therefore communicating with other injected services as well) or cleanup on deletion. This can be tested in an easy way by mocking the injected services and testing all the public methods.

### Testing Services

## Queries

### Abstract types

Graphql offers the ability to specify abstract types to share a set of fields between object types. It requires some time though to think of possible use cases but in general it's good practice to use them for larger applications. F.e. a github `User` type implements the following abstract types (besides others):

| Type         | Description                                                                     | Also implemented by               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Node         | Things that all nodes share in common (see chapter below)                       | All objects                       |
| Actor        | avatarUrl, username, resourcePath (profile url)                                 | EnterpriseUser, Organization, Bot |
| ProjectOwner | a projects list, a boolean which says if the viewer/me can create projects here | Organization, Repository          |

### Nodes

A node is every entity which has an id field. It should be an interface and implemented by every type in the app.

```js
// nexusjs approach
const Node = interfaceType({
  name: "Node",
  definition(t) {
    t.id("id", { description: "GUID for a resource" });
  },
});

const User = objectType({
  name: "User",
  definition(t) {
    t.implements("Node");
    t.model.email();
    t.model.firstName();
    t.model.lastName();
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Me / Viewer

The logged in user is part of the root query object and should be queryable as "me" or "viewer". It's in general of type `User`, but can be created as a separate type if it has additional fields that only the active user can query.

```js
// nexusjs approach
const ProfileOwner = interfaceType({
  name: "ProfileOwner",
  definition(t) {
    t.string("email");
    t.string("name");
  },
});
const User = objectType({
  name: "User",
  definition(t) {
    t.implements("Node");
    t.implements("ProfileOwner");
  },
});

export const Query = extendType({
  type: "Query",
  definition(t) {
    t.field("me", {
      nullable: true,
      type: User,
      resolve: (root, args, context) => {
        return context.user;
      },
    });
  },
});
```

### Root Query Object

The root query object should only contain queries that are usable by every user. The resolvers there should be written in a way that it hides information from the user that he's not allowed to see, either by implementing queries accordingly or by filtering stuff that's not supposed to be found through authorization. In case there's something that only administrators can do, it should be prefixed with `admin` to mark it clearly for the api user.

## Mutations

### Results

Mutations should return objects containing the entities they edited. That way the cache can easily be updated when something changes on the backend. Also if you return an object rather than the entity itself you can later easily extend the result with further nodes that might interest the api user.

```graphql
type LoginResult {
  user: User!
  token: String!
}
```

## Input validation

Input validation is part of the resolver. It depends on the args. You could provide input validation in the service but the resolver should then map those errors to the input args.

## Security

### Authentication

Authentication should be implemented by using a token (f.e. JWT) that comes with each request and can be used to load a user into the `context` of a request.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    // get the user token from the headers
    const token = ctx.req.headers.authorization || ctx.req.cookies?.token;

    // try to retrieve a user with the token
    const user = getUser(token);

    // add the user to the context
    return { user };
  },
});
```

### Authorization

#### Field Authorization

#### Type Authorization

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#authorization

### Protection from malicious queries

```gql
query maliciousQuery {
  thread(id: "some-id") {
    messages(first: 99999) {
      thread {
        messages(first: 99999) {
          thread {
            messages(first: 99999) {
              thread {
                # ...repeat times 10000...
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restrict the query depth by using https://github.com/stems/graphql-depth-limit

```js
app.use(
  "/api",
  graphqlServer({
    validationRules: [depthLimit(10)],
  })
);
```

## NEXTJS

Pass on cookies for initial render

```js
setContext(() => {
  const headers: {
    "accept-language"?: string;
    authorization?: string;
  } = {
    ["accept-language"]: i18n.language,
  };

  // add auth header for ssr executed
  // queries to pass the cookie token
  const token = (ctx?.req as any)?.cookies?.token;
  if (!process.browser && token) {
    headers.authorization = token;
  }

  return {
    headers,
  };
}) as any,
```
